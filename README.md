# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia

This project focuses on predicting rain in Australia using various machine learning algorithms. Specifically, the following algorithms have been employed:
### Linear Regression
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
### Decision Trees
### Logistic Regression
### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of these models is assessed using a range of evaluation metrics:
### Accuracy Score: Measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions made.
### Jaccard Index: Calculates the similarity between predicted and true labels, particularly useful for binary classification.
### F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them.
### LogLoss: Measures the performance of a classification model where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
### Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of the absolute differences between predicted and true values.
### Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of the squares of the errors between predicted and true values.
### R2-Score: Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
