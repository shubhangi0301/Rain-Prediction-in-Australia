# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia

This project focuses on predicting rain in Australia using various machine-learning algorithms. Specifically, the following algorithms have been employed:
#### Linear Regression
#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### Decision Trees
#### Logistic Regression
#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Evaluation Metrics
The performance of these models is assessed using a range of evaluation metrics:
- **Accuracy Score:** Measures the proportion of correct predictions from the total predictions made.
- **Jaccard Index:** Calculates the similarity between predicted and true labels, handy for binary classification.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing them.
- **LogLoss:** Measures the performance of a classification model where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average of the absolute differences between predicted and true values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of the squares of the errors between predicted and true values.
- **R2-Score:** Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
