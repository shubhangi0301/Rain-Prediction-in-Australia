# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia
### This project was done as a part of the Honors portion of the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera
Used a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms to the data. Used classification algorithms to create a model based on the training data and evaluated the testing data using various evaluation metrics.

Used these algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

#### Evaluation Metrics
The performance of these models is assessed using a range of evaluation metrics:
- **Accuracy Score:** Measures the proportion of correct predictions from the total predictions made.
- **Jaccard Index:** Calculates the similarity between predicted and true labels, handy for binary classification.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing them.
- **LogLoss:** Measures the performance of a classification model where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average of the absolute differences between predicted and true values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of the squares of the errors between predicted and true values.
- **R2-Score:** Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
